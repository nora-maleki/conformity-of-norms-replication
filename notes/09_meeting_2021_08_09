Meeting between Felix and Tobias:

Allocation of participants to random groups:
  - doing the allocation completely randomly is fine (even if the numbers of participants per group are a bit different)
  - allocation based in some way on the allocation of previous participants is very hard to do (-> we should not do it)
  
Declaration of sample size in Preregistration:
  - use a realistic number (eg. 60 participants)
  - motivate this number with
      + some statistical or methodological arguments 
      + arguments about timeframe and other logistical issues
  - it is no problem if the actual number of participants is a bit lower or a bit higher than originally planned
      + (declaration of samplesize is not that important for bayesian data analysis anyway)

Moral dilemma view:
  - Its fine as it is
  
Levels in preregistration report:
  - mention which indipendent variables we have and which levels they have
  
Experiment is good as it is, only thing left to do is improving identity check
