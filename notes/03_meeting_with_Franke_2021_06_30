Meeting with Franke, Felix and Steffen

Can we change the stimuli?
  He's happy that we ran into that problem
  There is no right or wrong
  "Der Weg ist das Ziel"
  That does NOT mean we can just do whatever we want, we have to justify our
  decisions
  Ask ourselfs, what is a direct replication
    Was does the paper say, what does it try to find out
    What do we think is the point/argument of the paper, that is tested with the experiment
    How to stay as close to the original paper as possible?
    How do we capture the spirit of the Paper
    The result of our experiment is not that important, so even if we get nothing out of it,
      its okay, whats more important is the correctness of the methods we use
  Stay as close as possible and capture the spirit of the paper, when making changes

Since we don't have to do much work on the stimuli is there something else we
can dive into instead (like coming up with new stimuli)
  Franke doesn't have an idea immediately
  If we have good ideas we can implement them
  Goes further away from a direct replication
  Make clear in prereg what part is replication and what is exploration by us


After meeting with Franke, Felix and Steffen talked about the materials
as preparation for the meeting on Friday

Gun control: “Adults should have the right to carry a concealed handgun”
  -Keep it, also makes sense in Germany, even though it is not as big a topic

Feminism: “Feminism is important and beneficial to modern society”
  -Keep

Donald Trump: “Donald Trump being president is good for the United States at this time”
  -Maybe change Donald Trump for Merkel, Baerbock, afd?

Immigration and Dreamers: "Dreamers (undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children)
should be allowed to stay in the United States"
  -Does not make much sense in Germany, no better suggestions yet

Transgender rights: “Transgender people should be allowed to use the bathrooms
of the gender they identify as"
  -Keep

Drug legalization: "Possession of drugs should be legalized"
  -Keep

Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem: “"Colin Kaepernick was wrong
to kneel during the national anthem"
  -Leave out entirely, nobody will choose it anyway
  -Argument: Not many people will have even heard the story

Buying and wearing fur: "Buying and wearing fur is wrong"
  -Keep

Taxing religious organization: "Religious organizations should be taxed"
  -Keep


Identity check:
  -Not necessary to contact the authors i.e use original questions, since it's
  not part of the data we analyse and easy to replicate the bigger point of the
  identity check.
  -We will ask a Tutor though since, after talking about it, it seemed more difficult
  than expected
