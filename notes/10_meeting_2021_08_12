Meeting with Nora, Felix and Steffen

Experiment is ready to be deployed
  -Experiment will be deployed today (12.08)
    -Reset experiment on server
    -Merge experiment into experiment/main

Data Analysis:
  -We may have problems interpreting our results, because we don't have
  a big enough sample size
  -Thoughts about using Anova instead of ordinal logistical regression
    -Anova is  less complicated
    -OLR is easier to interpret and compare, because we have the interpretation of
    the original experiment
    -OLR is easier to justify since its in the original analysis
    -We don't need any priors for ANOVA
  -Meet again on Monday (16.08) 13 o'clock to talk about analysis in depth
    -Beforehand: Look into analysis individually
      -Try to understand whats happening in the original paper
      -Try to implement
    -Can we find the priors?
  -Also meet afterwards with TUTOR 15 o'clock to talk about problems
