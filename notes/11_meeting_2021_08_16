Meeting with everyone

Sending the experiment through the E-mail Verteiler of the University
  -We clarify to not do the experiment, if they already did the same experiment
  of another group
  -End of data gathering: 22.08.2021

Data Analysis Update by Nora:
  -We are not sure how they ordered the ingroup and outgroup variables for
  the ordinal logistical regression -> ask TUTOR
  -Priors are given in the paper, but we can also try to build our own
  priors from their results

Final report:
  -General structure on google docs
  -Reuse some writing from experimental design (has to be updated)
  -Write down the versions of our programs (R, Magpie, ...)

Plan for next days:
  -Try to get the model working: Nora
  -Start working on final report: Steffen

Next meeting: Sunday, 22.08.2021
