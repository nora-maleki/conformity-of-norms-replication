Meeting with everyone

Analysis:
  -First model gives output, but we are not sure how to interpret them
  -Try to use brms instead of stan, because we know how to interpret brms results
  -We only really have to analyse the Model comparison (BF) and not the models itself,
  so we can use the stan models
  -We then tried to compare their results of the frequentist analysis with ours

Next steps:
  -Work on plots
  -Understand effect size and how they got CI
  -Afterwards finish the Final report
    -Make list of software used with versions
    -Make list of references
  -Clean repository
    -Update README files so they explain what the files are

Next Meeting: Sunday, 29.08.2021 15:00 o'clock to work on the final report
