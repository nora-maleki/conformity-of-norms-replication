Meeting from 2nd of Juli 2021 with everyone

Discussion about experimental design
  E.g. what templates to use, how the four groups are divided and what they are shown
  -> See Nora's flowchart
  Identity check:
    What is it for exactly (data exclusion/data for analyses)
    Do we use two scales or one?
  Question for Tobias:
    How do we randomize participant distribution?
      Use inbuild (nested) coin toss?


Inform Nora and Tjark about contents of meeting with Prof. Franke

Discussion about materials i.e. political questions
  Which to keep and which to drop:

  Gun control: “Adults should have the right to carry a concealed handgun”
    -Keep it, also makes sense in Germany, even though it is not as big a topic

  Feminism: “Feminism is important and beneficial to modern society”
    -Keep

  Donald Trump: “Donald Trump being president is good for the United States at this time”
    -Maybe change Donald Trump for Merkel, Baerbock, afd?
    -Group chose AfD
    -New Formulation: AfD: "AfD winning the next federal election will be good for Germany"

  Immigration and Dreamers: "Dreamers (undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children)
  should be allowed to stay in the United States"
    -Does not make much sense in Germany, no better suggestions yet
    -New Formulation: Should Refugees be allowed to stay in Germany?
    -Can we come up with a better one?

  Transgender rights: “Transgender people should be allowed to use the bathrooms
  of the gender they identify as"
    -Keep

  Drug legalization: "Possession of drugs should be legalized"
    -Keep

  Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem: “"Colin Kaepernick was wrong
  to kneel during the national anthem"
    -Leave out entirely, nobody will choose it anyway
    -Argument: Not many people will have even heard the story
    -Thought: Maybe change for Manuel Neuer wearing rainbow flag during Hungary game

  Buying and wearing fur: "Buying and wearing fur is wrong"
    -Keep

  Taxing religious organization: "Religious organizations should be taxed"
    -Keep

Identity Check:
-We don't want to bias participants with our made up formulations, so it would be better
to have the original sentences

Task distribution:
  Implementation: Norah, Felix, Tjark
  Prereg part: Steffen
For next meeting:

Date for next meeting:
