Meeting with Felix, Tjark, Steffen

Discussion about feedback from Tutor on prereg:
  Study Design:
    -Do we use Levels or groups?
    -TODO: Give the variables names in study design
  Data Collection procedures:
    -TODO: Give the names of the software and hosting services we use
  Sample size & rationale:
    -We can't really give a reason for a minimum participant number, ask Tutor next meeting
  Statistical Models:
    -TODO: Give full name of model and formula
    -We need to ask Nora about that

Feedback from participants on experiment:
  Difference between immigrants and Refugees not clear defined:
    -We decided to leave it as refugees since it was probably a lack of English
    vocabulary and this is not the point of the study, instead we only want them
    to strongly agree with on side
  There is a lot to read and it gets confusing:
    -Idea: Use color coding and bold, but we are not sure if that biases
    -Ask TUTOR if we can change the stimulus
  Give more motivation in introduction, maybe a picture:
    -We are not a fan of visual stimuli. The experiment looks boring but it
    is a scientific experiment after all
    -Give motivation on what the participant can learn by doing the experiment
  Identity check buttons looks weird:
    -Already fixed

Basic information view:
  -We decided to delete city, country and education

Randomization:
  -Right now the participant are distributed randomly to groups, so we could have on group
  with 10 participants and another with 5. maybe it makes sense to randomize in
  a way that the groups are equally filled. Ask TUTOR.

Work distribution:
  -Implement Prereg Feedback after meeting with Tutor: Steffen
  -Implement Feedback and changes to experiment: Felix, Tjark
  -Help Nora with Data analysis: Everyone

TODO:
  -Finish data analysis
  -Run main experiment
  -Write final report
  -Clean up repository (e.g. update READMEs)
