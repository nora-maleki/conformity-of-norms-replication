Meeting with Tutor and everyone to obtain feedback experimental design


Tutor Feedback:
  Try to be precise and understandable
  Get perspective of uninformed reader
  Follow APA Guidelines and recommended structure
    -Mostly did that already

  Design part:
    -Be more precise
    -Difficult to understand
    -Levels used wrong -> should be groups

  We are allowed to change topics
    -But justify it -> also in the Experimental Design Paper
    -Personal opinion:
      -leave out Church Tax
      -Should Refugees be allowed to come here

  Feedback on identity check:
    -Come up with ideas of proper phrasing
    -Try it out on people and ask for feedback
    -Profit

  Gut-Feeling: Likert scale on same page with Dilemma

  Exploratory part:
    -Focus on the main thing
    -Don't spend recourses on that, when you're not done with the main part
    -We can still explore for fun
    -We can ask questions, even if we don't analyse them
      -Make exploratory part clear in prereg, in the hypothesis part
      -Also state in final report if we are not able to analyse the data

    -Try to imagine what answer you will get
    -Try to imagine what these answers will tell you
    -Why are you asking questions this way
    -Biased questions can alter answers
    -Statements better than questions:
      -"The opinions of others are an important factor to finding my own"

Summary:
  -Refine stuff
  -Get feedback
  -Hand it back in
  -More feedback
  -More profit

Meeting afterwards at 17:00 with Nora, Tjark, Steffen
  -Short discussion about exploratory questions
  -Felix and Tjark will start with implementing

Next meeting date: TBD, depending on implementation
