# *experiments* folder

### 01_pilot
* The code for the main experiment is in the pilot folder. This is because we launch the experiment from this folder and we don't want to break anything. The code from the pilot release can be found here: [![pilot_release](https://img.shields.io/badge/pilot%20release-1.0-darkgreen.svg)](https://github.com/nora-maleki/conformity-of-norms-replication/releases/tag/1.0_pilot_version)

### 02_main
* The link to the main version's release is contained in the folder's readme
