# Experimental Design
### Conformity to the Descriptive Norms of People with Opposing Political or Social Beliefs - Replication

## Background
According to the descriptive norm effect individuals tend to choose an action that the majority of a group of people have chosen before them. It is still not known whether the descriptive norm effect also applies if the individual does not identify with the group (e.g. due to opposing political opinions). The self-categorization theory predicts that individuals will seek to deliberately not conform with a group of people they do not identify with (called the “outgroup”). Pryor et al. (2019) tested this hypothesis in “Conformity to Descriptive Norms of people with opposing political or social beliefs” by presenting some participants with information about how the majority of people with whom they identify with (their “ingroup”) decided to act when faced with a certain moral dilemma and some participants with information about ingroup and outgroup decisions. We replicated this experiment and added exploratory questions to test whether the understanding of the information or the amount of antipathy for the outgroup are important factors on how much people conform with the outgroup.
## Hypothesis
We are interested in this interplay of self-categorization and descriptive norms and are going to test the following two research hypotheses:

1.  **Hypothesis**: According to self-categorization theory, participants will not choose actions that are practiced by the determined outgroup.  
2.  **Alternative Hypothesis**: According to the descriptive norm effect, participants will choose the action that is the most popular, disregarding ingroups or outgroups.

## Design
We will use a 2x2 between subjects design, so we will have two independent variables with two levels each. (See: Table in Procedure)

The first independent variable will be the presentation of the descriptive norm. Either we will present only the descriptive norm of the ingroup or we will present both the descriptive norm of ingroup and outgroup. If both descriptive norms are shown, the order in which they are presented will be random.  

The second independent variable will be the content of the descriptive norm of the ingroup. Either we will display the ingroup as favouring the report of the robber or we will display the ingroup as favouring not reporting the robber.


The dependent variable will be the participants rating of their certainty with which they would perform one of the two possible actions (reporting or not reporting the robber). The rating will be conducted on a 6-point Likert scale.  

We are going to exclude all participants who fail to pass the understanding check because this indicates that they did not pay enough attention. Additionally all participants who report to be neutral about their chosen social issue will be excluded since in this case we are not able to determine ingroup and outgroup.


## Procedure

(1) Introduction  
(2) Determine the ingroup  
(3) Instructions  
(4) Presentation of moral dilemma  
(5) Questionnaire  

After the participants are welcomed, they are given some general information. This includes that this study is a follow up to another study, some general information about this study i.e. that there will be political questions, a moral dilemma, that participation is completely voluntary and that their data will be stored anonymously. After they consent to these conditions and begin the experiment, they are able to choose from eight topics about social issues. In the following they are presented with a statement concerning their topic, which they can agree or disagree with, using an 11-point Likert scale. This is to assign the participants to their ingroup, depending on the rating of the chosen social issue. Some of the topics had to be altered, since they are only relevant to American politics. When changing a topic our goal was to find a similar and equally controversial topic relevant to Germany. We kept in mind, that the questions are supposed to make participants strongly agree with one side. When a topic is altered we give an explanation on why it was altered and what the original topic was below.  
The topics in our experiment are:  

* **Gun control:** “Adults should have the right to carry a concealed handgun”  
* **Feminism:** “Feminism is important and beneficial to modern society”  
* **AfD:** "AfD winning the next federal election will be good for Germany"
    * Changed from: Donald Trump: “Donald Trump being president is good for the United States at this time”  
    * Reason: Donald Trump is a very controversial American politician, but not everybody in Germany is interested in American politics and has a strong opinion on him, so we changed the question to what we think is the equally controversial German equivalent, the AfD.
* **Refugees:** "Germany should open its borders for all refugees"
    * Changed from: Immigration and Dreamers: "Dreamers (undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children) should be allowed to stay in the United States"
    * Reason: The term "Dreamers" does not exist in Germany, but for the past years there where a lot of controversial discussions around the topic of refugees, which is similar the topic of immigration and Dreamers.
* **Transgender rights:** “Transgender people should be allowed to use the bathrooms of the gender they identify as"
* **Drug legalization:** "Possession of drugs should be legalized"
* **Buying and wearing fur:** "Buying and wearing fur is wrong"
* **Taxing religious organization:** "Religious organizations should be taxed"
* **Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem:** "Colin Kaepernick was wrong to kneel during the national anthem”
    * Left out entirely
    * Reason: None of our group members had heard the name Colin Kaepernick before this, so we decided to not include it in our experiment, since we don't think most of the German population is familiar with this incident.



Next they will be presented with instructions. After they are told that a moral dilemma will be proposed to them, they will also be told that this study is following a previous study where data on that moral dilemma was collected. This is to justify the descriptive norms the participants will be presented with later.  
After the instructions participants are presented with the moral dilemma:  
*“Imagine you have witnessed a man rob a bank. However, you then saw him do something unexpected with the money. He donated it all to a run-down orphanage that would benefit greatly from the money. You must decide whether to call the police and report the robber or do nothing and leave the robber alone.”*  
Besides being presented with the moral dilemma the participants are also presented with a descriptive norm. What exactly is shown is dependent on which of four groups the participants are randomly assigned to.



|  |   |
|------|---|
| [Moral Dilemma]  <br>60% ingroup choose act A | [Moral Dilemma] <br> 60% ingroup choose act B  |
| [Moral Dilemma] <br> 60% ingroup choose act A <br> 85% outgroup choose act B | [Moral Dilemma] <br> 60% ingroup choose act B <br> 85% outgroup choose act A |




Participants will then rate with which certainty they would report or not report the robber using a 6-point Likert scale. Afterwards the participants are asked to rate how they feel about their answer, but this is only done to stay consistent with the fictitious earlier study and the resulting data will not be analysed.  
Participants will also have to pass an understanding check including four questions about the previous study, to make sure they paid attention:  
1. Participants chose which action they preferred (correct)
2. Due to a computer error, participants were not allocated equally to imagine performing the different actions (incorrect)
3. No data was saved during the experiment. (incorrect)
4. The participants completed the experiment with their eyes closed. (incorrect)  

The last question the participants are presented with is a single-item social identification measure, making sure to which degree they identify with their ingroup and outgroup. It consists of two questions:  
1. “I Identify with [ingroup]”
2. “I identify with [outgroup]”  
In the end participants will be thanked for their participation




Following the identity check we will be doing another understanding check that is exploratory and will be more directed towards the perception of the responses from the experimental trail. We will ask the participant “Which of the following statements is true?” and present two options:  
1. The majority of people who agreed with you on [topic] chose to leave the robber alone.
2. The majority of people who agreed with you on [topic] chose to call the police.  

The correct answer depends on the condition the participant was in. This understanding checks aims to test the participants understanding of the bit of information that is most central for the success of the experiment.  
Next, the participant will be presented another exploratory question where they have to rate on a likert scale from 1 to 7 how much they agree with the following statement:  
1. I would prefer the company of someone who agrees with me on [topic] over the company of someone who disagrees with me on [topic].  

With this question we try to measure the participants antipathy towards their outgroup.

After that, the participant will have reached the last page on which they will provide demographic information about them including only age and gender, since other demographic details are not necessary and won’t be analysed anyway. For the pilot there will also be a comment section. In the end participants will be thanked for their participation.
