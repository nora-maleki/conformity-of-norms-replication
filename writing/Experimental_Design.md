# Design for “Conformity of Norms” replication

## Background
In group dynamics there are often two opposing effects at play. On one side urging an individual to conform to group norms and other people behaviors, called the descriptive norm effect, and on the other side the effect of an individual wanting or not wanting to conform to other groups standards based on their own beliefs, values and identification with a certain group, called the self-categorization theory. To see which effect is stronger and may outweigh the other, we will present participants with a moral dilemma, followed by the response of other people to that dilemma. This response will be manufactured and either comes from people the participant identifies or does not identify with. The identification of the participant will be determined beforehand, when the participant has to indicate their stance on a political topic they strongly care about, e.g gun control or drug legalization. This opinion will divide the topic of interest into ingroups, the group that the participant identifies with, and outgroups, the group the participant does not identify with.
## Hypothesis
We are interested in this interplay of self-categorization and descriptive norms and are going to test the following two research hypotheses:

1.  **Hypothesis**: According to self-categorization theory, participants will not choose actions that are practiced by the determined outgroup.  
2.  **Alternative Hypothesis**: According to the descriptive norm effect, participants will choose the action that is the most popular, disregarding ingroups or outgroups.

## Design
We will use a 2x2 between subjects design, so we will have two independent variables with two levels each.  

The first independent variable will be the presentation of the descriptive norm. On the first level we will only present the descriptive norm of the ingroup, on the second level we will present both the descriptive norm of ingroup and outgroup. If both descriptive norms are shown, the order in which they are presented will be random.  

The second independent variable will be the content of the descriptive norm of the ingroup. On the first level we will display the ingroup as favouring the report of the robber, on the second level we will display the ingroup as favouring not reporting the robber.  

The dependent variable will be the participants rating of their certainty with which they would perform one of the two possible actions (reporting or not reporting the robber). The rating will be conducted on a 6-point Likert scale.  

We are going to exclude all participants who fail to pass the understanding check because this indicates that they did not pay enough attention. Additionally all participants who report to be neutral about their chosen social issue will be excluded since in this case we are not able to determine ingroup and outgroup.

## Procedure

(1) Introduction  
(2) Determine the ingroup  
(3) Instructions  
(4) Presentation of moral dilemma  
(5) Questionnaire  

After the participants are welcomed and asked for general information (age, gender), they are able to choose from nine topics about social issues. After choosing, they are presented with a statement concerning their topic, which they can agree or disagree with, using an 11-point Likert scale. This is to assign the participants to their ingroup, depending on the rating of the chosen social issue. Some of the topics had to be altered, since they are only relevant to American politics. The topics in our experiment are:  

* **Gun control:** “Adults should have the right to carry a concealed handgun”  
* **Feminism:** “Feminism is important and beneficial to modern society”  
* **AfD:** "AfD winning the next federal election will be good for Germany"
    * Changed from: Donald Trump: “Donald Trump being president is good for the United States at this time”  
* **Refugees:** “Should Refugees be allowed to stay in Germany?”
    * Changed from: Immigration and Dreamers: "Dreamers (undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children) should be allowed to stay in the United States"
* **Transgender rights:** “Transgender people should be allowed to use the bathrooms of the gender they identify as"
* **Drug legalization:** "Possession of drugs should be legalized"
* **Buying and wearing fur:** "Buying and wearing fur is wrong"
* **Taxing religious organization:** "Religious organizations should be taxed"
* **Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem:** "Colin Kaepernick was wrong to kneel during the national anthem”
    * Left out entirely



Next they will be presented with instructions. After they are told that a moral dilemma will be proposed to them, they will also be told that this study is following a previous study where data on that moral dilemma was collected. This is to justify the descriptive norms the participants will be presented with later.  
After the instructions participants are presented with the moral dilemma:  
*“Imagine you have witnessed a man rob a bank. However, you then saw him do something unexpected with the money. He donated it all to a run-down orphanage that would benefit greatly from the money. You must decide whether to call the police and report the robber or do nothing and leave the robber alone.”*  
Besides being presented with the moral dilemma the participants are also presented with a descriptive norm. What exactly is shown is dependent on which of four groups the participants are randomly assigned to.



|  |   |
|------|---|
| [Moral Dilemma]  <br>60% ingroup choose act A | [Moral Dilemma] <br> 60% ingroup choose act B  |
| [Moral Dilemma] <br> 60% ingroup choose act A <br> 85% outgroup choose act B | [Moral Dilemma] <br> 60% ingroup choose act B <br> 85% outgroup choose act A |




Participants will then rate with which certainty they would report or not report the robber using a 6-point Likert scale. Afterwards the participants are asked to rate how they feel about their answer, but this is only done to stay consistent with the fictitious earlier study and the resulting data will not be analysed.  
Participants will also have to pass an understanding check including four questions about the previous study, to make sure they paid attention:  
1. Participants chose which action they preferred (correct)
2. Due to a computer error, participants were not allocated equally to imagine performing the different actions (incorrect)
3. No data was saved during the experiment. (incorrect)
4. The participants completed the experiment with their eyes closed. (incorrect)  

The last question the participants are presented with is a single-item social identification measure, making sure to which degree they identify with their ingroup and outgroup. It consists of two questions:  
1. “I Identify with [ingroup]”
2. “I identify with [outgroup]”  
In the end participants will be thanked for their participation

Exploratory ideas:
* How important was the given information about the response of the other participants for your decision
* How much was your decision influenced by the response of the other participants?
* Is morality relative to society or does it have an objective foundation?
* How much do you trust the choice of people agreeing with you on [the chosen topic]?
* How much do you trust the choice of people disagreeing with you on [the chosen topic]?
* Something like:
People who disagree/agree with the statement [the chosen statement] are unlike
