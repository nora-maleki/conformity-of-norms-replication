### Creating labels

```{r}
# creating a vector of changed labels to used them later in the plot
both_norms_shown_cat_labels <- c(
  "both_in_and_outgroup" = "Both in- and outgroup",
  "only_ingroup" = "Only ingroup"
)
```



### Ploting mean response of the main trial

```{r}
df_cleaned %>%
  filter(
    trial_name == "experimental_trial"
    ) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(
      ingroup_descriptive_norm_cat,
      mean(as.numeric(response))
      ), 
    ) +
  geom_boxplot(
    size = 3,
    alpha = .8, 
    color = "darkred"
    ) +
  facet_wrap(
    ~ both_norms_shown_cat,
    labeller = labeller(
      both_norms_shown_cat = both_norms_shown_cat_labels
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Ingroup Norm",
    y = "Mean response",
    title = "Mean response in both norms shown condition") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5, margin = margin(b = 30)),
    plot.margin = margin(t = 30, r = 35),
    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 15, l = 20)),
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 15, b = 20))
  )
